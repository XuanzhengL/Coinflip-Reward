**Answer to the Question Regarding the New Parameters for the `UserInput` Function (The Code Is Already Implemented in the File):**

In order to integrate the `RewardUser` function within the `UserInput` function, the main requirement is to ensure that the contract has access to the winnerâ€™s address so that the reward (5 Dauphine tokens) can be properly minted and transferred. Since the caller of the `UserInput` function is the player themselves, we can utilize `msg.sender` directly to identify the winning address. This eliminates the need to introduce any new parameters solely for identifying the user. In addition, if the design were to support more complex scenarios, such as rewarding a third-party address (different from `msg.sender`), additional parameter like `address winner` could be added to the `UserInput` function.
